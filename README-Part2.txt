In part 1 you added functionality to the chatbot to give it potential responses
for a broader range of inputs. However, one issue is whether or not the chatbot
will always correctly identify when keywords are found. The goal of Part 2 is to
rectify some of these issues. Be prepared to reference the Java API to learn
some new String methods.

Task 1
ChatBot.java has an additional method called findKeyword(). Read and understand
its functionality.

Task 2
Rewrite the getResponse() method to implement findKeyword(). Have a new
conversation with the chatbot to ensure it is working correctly.
